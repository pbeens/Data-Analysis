# README.md

Welcome to this repository! 

My goal here is to share things I learn about data analysis using Python. The majority of the files I include will likely be Jupyter Notebooks because I like the inherent interactivity Jupyter Notebooks provide, the integration with Markdown (making documentation of the code so much easier), and the ability to easily "chunk" the code to aid in the teaching of how the code works.

# What's New? 

+ I've created a [Canadian Population Barchart notebook](Wikipedia/Canadian-Population-Barchart.ipynb) ([Colab](https://githubtocolab.com/pbeens/Data-Analysis/blob/main/Wikipedia/Canadian-Population-Barchart.ipynb) | [NBViewer](https://nbviewer.org/github/pbeens/Data-Analysis/blob/main/Wikipedia/Canadian-Population-Barchart.ipynb)) to show how to extract data from a table on a [page](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Population_of_Canada_by_province_and_territory) on Wikipedia. 
+ I've created a Python [utility](Utils/github-to-nbviewer-and-colab-links.py) which which will create the Colab and NBViewer links to let you view and/or experiment with a Jupyter notebook that's on GitHub. Look for it in the [Utils](Utils) folder or run it directly [here](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/12LdduTNAtMwC3oNohv8Y7dFkuJiPYFOd?usp=sharing).

# Problems Viewing?

Note: if you're having an issue with a Jupyter notebook not displaying in GitHub, go to https://nbviewer.org/ and paste in the URL of the notebook.

Alternatatively, you can display the notebook in **Google Colab** by changing the github part of the URL to githubtocolab. https://github.com/ would become https://githubtocolab.com/. 

I have written a utility which will take a GitHub ipynb URL and convert it for use with Colab and NBViewer. You can download the file from [here](Utils/github-to-nbviewer-and-colab-links.py).

# Miscellaneous 

+ [FAQs](FAQ.md)
+ If you need to quickly code some Python, why not try out JupyterLite?
