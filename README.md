# README.md

Welcome to this repository! 

My goal here is to share things I learn about data analysis using Python. The majority of the files I include will likely be Jupyter Notebooks because I like the inherent interactivity Jupyter Notebooks provide, the integration with Markdown (making documentation of the code so much easier), and the ability to easily "chunk" the code to aid in the teaching of how the code works.

# Problems?

Note: if you're having an issue with a notebook not displaying in GitHub, go to https://nbviewer.org/ and paste in the URL of the notebook.

Alternatatively, you can display the notebook in Google Colab by changing the github part of the URL to githubtocolab.
