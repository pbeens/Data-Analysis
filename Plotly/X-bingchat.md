Sure, I can help you with that. Plotly Express is a high-level API for creating figures in Python. It has more than 30 functions for different types of plots, such as scatter, line, bar, pie, histogram, etc. You can import it as `import plotly.express as px` and use it to create interactive and beautiful charts with just a few lines of code. You can also customize the charts using the `update_layout` and `add_trace` methods of the `plotly.graph_objects.Figure` object that every Plotly Express function returns¹.

Here are some basic assignments to use Plotly Express:

- To create a bar chart, you can use the `px.bar` function. For example, to create a bar chart of the number of cars per continent using the built-in `px.data.gapminder` dataset, you can do:

```python
import plotly.express as px
df = px.data.gapminder().query("year == 2007")
fig = px.bar(df, x="continent", y="pop", color="continent",
             labels={"pop": "population"}, hover_name="country")
fig.show()
```

- To create a line chart, you can use the `px.line` function. For example, to create a line chart of the life expectancy vs GDP per capita of Canada and the USA using the same dataset, you can do:

```python
import plotly.express as px
df = px.data.gapminder().query("country in ['Canada', 'United States']")
fig = px.line(df, x="gdpPercap", y="lifeExp", color="country")
fig.show()
```

- To create a histogram, you can use the `px.histogram` function. For example, to create a histogram of the tips distribution in the built-in `px.data.tips` dataset, you can do:

```python
import plotly.express as px
df = px.data.tips()
fig = px.histogram(df, x="tip")
fig.show()
```

- To create other interesting plots, you can explore the Plotly Express gallery¹ or the Plotly Express documentation². Some examples are:

  - A sunburst plot of the Titanic passengers' survival by class, sex and age using the built-in `px.data.tips` dataset:

  ```python
  import plotly.express as px
  df = px.data.titanic()
  fig = px.sunburst(df, path=['class', 'sex', 'age'], values='survived')
  fig.show()
  ```

  - A density contour plot of the Iris dataset using random data:

  ```python
  import plotly.express as px
  import numpy as np
  np.random.seed(42)
  df = px.data.iris()
  df['random'] = np.random.randn(len(df))
  fig = px.density_contour(df, x='random', y='sepal_length', color='species')
  fig.show()
  ```

  - A choropleth map of the world's GDP per capita using data from a website:

  ```python
  import plotly.express as px
  import pandas as pd
  url = 'https://raw.githubusercontent.com/plotly/datasets/master/2014_world_gdp_with_codes.csv'
  df = pd.read_csv(url)
  fig = px.choropleth(df, locations='CODE', color='GDP (BILLIONS)',
                      hover_name='COUNTRY', color_continuous_scale=px.colors.sequential.Plasma)
  fig.show()
  ```

I hope this helps you learn more about Plotly Express and how to use it for data visualization. Have fun!

This error is due to the nbformat package not being installed¹. You can install it using pip by running `pip install nbformat` in your terminal¹. If you've already installed it but still get the error, you can try upgrading the package by running `pip install --upgrade nbformat`¹.

I hope this helps!
