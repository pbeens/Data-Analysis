    "A *Google Sheet* is a web-based spreadsheet that can store and manipulate data online. However, to access a Google Sheet using the pandas function `pd.read_csv()`, which reads data from a comma-separated values (CSV) file, the Google Sheet has to be converted to a CSV format. This can be done by changing the filename ending of the Google Sheet URL to `/export?format=csv`. This tells Google to export the Google Sheet as a CSV file and return the link to the file. The pandas function can then read the data from the link and create a dataframe. \n",
