# PS43-README.md

I will add notes here as I develop support material to go along with the Callysto resources found [here](https://github.com/callysto/basketball-and-data-science).

The short URL of this document is [bit.ly/ps43-doc](https://bit.ly/ps43-doc).

[PS43: Introduction to Python, Jupyter, and pandas: Introduction to Data Science and Basketball](https://hub.callysto.ca/jupyter/hub/user-redirect/git-pull?repo=https%3A%2F%2Fgithub.com%2Fcallysto%2Fbasketball-and-data-science&branch=main&subPath=content/01-introduction.ipynb&depth=1) **CAUTION**: This will mirror the entire  repository into Callysto and will overwrite any previous changes you've made. Do this with caution! (Tip: save any changed files to your local or school drive after making changes, or rename them first.)
