# PS43: Start here!

I will add notes here as I develop support material to go along with the Callysto resources found [here](https://github.com/callysto/basketball-and-data-science).

# Where to Start

1. Lesson: [jupyter-notebook-demo.ipynb](Demos/jupyter-notebook-demo.ipynb) (Open in [Callysto](https://hub.callysto.ca/jupyter/hub/user-redirect/git-pull?repo=https://github.com/pbeens/Data-Analysis&branch=main&subPath=Demos/jupyter-notebook-demo.ipynb&depth=1) | [Colab](https://githubtocolab.com/pbeens/Data-Analysis/blob/main/Demos/jupyter-notebook-demo.ipynb))

1. Lesson: [where-can-we-get-data-from.ipynb](Demos/where-can-we-get-data-from.ipynb) (Open in
   in [Callysto](https://hub.callysto.ca/jupyter/hub/user-redirect/git-pull?repo=https://github.com/pbeens/Data-Analysis&branch=main&subPath=Demos/where-can-we-get-data-from.ipynb&depth=1) | [Colab](https://githubtocolab.com/pbeens/Data-Analysis/blob/main/Demos/where-can-we-get-data-from.ipynb))

1. Class Activity: [population-challenge.ipynb](Plotly/Challenges/population-challenge.ipynb). (Open in [Callysto](https://hub.callysto.ca/jupyter/hub/user-redirect/git-pull?repo=https://github.com/pbeens/Data-Analysis&branch=main&subPath=Plotly/Challenges/population-challenge.ipynb&depth=1) | [Colab](https://githubtocolab.com/pbeens/Data-Analysis/blob/main/Plotly/Challenges/population-challenge.ipynb))


1. [PS43: Introduction to Python, Jupyter, and pandas: Introduction to Data Science and Basketball](https://hub.callysto.ca/jupyter/hub/user-redirect/git-pull?repo=https%3A%2F%2Fgithub.com%2Fcallysto%2Fbasketball-and-data-science&branch=main&subPath=content/01-introduction.ipynb&depth=1) **CAUTION**: This will mirror the entire  repository into Callysto and will overwrite any previous changes you've made. Do this with caution! (Tip: save any changed files to your local or school drive after making changes, or rename them first.)
