This was a bit if a bust. When opening a notebook with the newly generated ToC in Callysto I would get this error:

`Notebook validation failed: Additional properties are not allowed ('id' was unexpected):
{
 "attachments": {},
 "cell_type": "markdown",
 "id": "04ceb7da",
 "metadata": {},
 "source": "# Table of Contents\n\n"
}`

In Colab, I didn't get any errors but the links didn't work.

In GitHib, the links brought returned us to the home page of the repo.

It would have been nice to get this working. Perhaps someone else can make it work.
