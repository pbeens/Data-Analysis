This program was written with the help of Bing Chat. I also asked it for an interesting Wikipedia article that has Canadian content that has a table with data that can be plotted. 

As part of my prompt I gave Bing Chat the program requirements:

- Write a Python program that uses `pd.read_clipboard()` to copy and paste the data from a table on a Wikipedia article that has Canadian content on it and has a table with data that can be plotted.
- Ask the user to copy the data from the clipboard into the program.
- Output the data into a CSV file named "data.csv".

One possible Wikipedia article that has Canadian content on it and has a table with data that can be plotted is Media of CanadaÂ¹. It has a table that shows the market share of Canadian media corporations in 2015, which can be visualized as a pie chart or a bar graph. The article also covers various aspects of Canadian media, such as history, regulation, multiculturalism, and regional differences. It might be interesting to learn how Canada preserves and promotes its cultural identity through media in the face of foreign influences.ðŸ‡¨ðŸ‡¦
