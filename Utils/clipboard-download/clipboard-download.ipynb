    "One possible Wikipedia article that has Canadian content on it and has a table with data that can be plotted is **Media of Canada**Â¹. It has a table that shows the **market share of Canadian media corporations** in 2015, which can be visualized as a pie chart or a bar graph. The article also covers various aspects of Canadian media, such as history, regulation, multiculturalism, and regional differences. It might be interesting to learn how Canada preserves and promotes its cultural identity through media in the face of foreign influences.ðŸ‡¨ðŸ‡¦\n",
