    "This program reads in a CSV file containing data on the most commonly spoken languages at home in Niagara Falls, Ontario, homes. It then extracts the columns that contain data on the total number of speakers for each language and creates a new DataFrame with these columns. The program then calculates the total number of speakers for each language and finds the 20 most commonly spoken languages. Finally, it creates a bar chart using Plotly Express to display the top 20 languages and their total number of speakers."
