I will add notes to this resource as I develop support material to go along with the Callysto resources found [here](https://github.com/callysto/basketball-and-data-science).

The short URL of this document is [bit.ly/data-dunkers-doc](https://bit.ly/data-dunkers-doc). 

*Note: if you plan to use Callysto for these lessons you can mirror the entire repository into it by clicking [here](https://hub.callysto.ca/jupyter/hub/user-redirect/git-pull?repo=https://github.com/pbeens/Data-Analysis&branch=main&subPath=Data-Dunkers-README.md&depth=1).*
