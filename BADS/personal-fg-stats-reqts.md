You have been collecting data on the number of field goal attempts made (FGA) and the number of field goals(FG).

Record this data in a Google Sheet, in this format:

|Day #|FG|FGA|
|--|--|--|
|1|3|10|
|2|4|10|
|3|4|10|
|4|5|10|

Create a Jupyter Notebook named "*Initials* Field Goal Attempts". In this notebook, write a program that imports this data from your Google Sheet, calculates Field Goal Percentage (FG%) from your two columns, and plots it in the plot format of your choice.

Be sure you include a suitable title and rename the x- and y-axes to "Day #" and "Field Goal %", respectively.
